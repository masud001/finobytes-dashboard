# Netlify Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the Finobytes Dashboard to Netlify.

## 🚀 Quick Deployment (Recommended)

### Method 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Netlify deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose "GitHub" and authorize Netlify
   - Select your `finobytes-dashboard` repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - **Base directory**: `finobytes-dashboard`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `finobytes-dashboard/dist`
   - **Node version**: `18` (set in Environment variables)

4. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site

### Method 2: Manual Deploy

1. **Build the project locally**:
   ```bash
   cd finobytes-dashboard
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Drag and drop the `finobytes-dashboard/dist` folder to the deploy area

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

The following files have been created for Netlify deployment:

### `netlify.toml`
- Build configuration
- Redirect rules for SPA routing
- Security headers
- Environment variables

### `_redirects`
- Fallback redirects for client-side routing
- Ensures all routes work properly in the SPA

### Updated `vite.config.ts`
- Added base path configuration
- Optimized chunk splitting for better performance

## 🔧 Environment Variables

If you need to set environment variables in Netlify:

1. Go to your site dashboard
2. Navigate to "Site settings" > "Environment variables"
3. Add any required variables (currently none are required for basic functionality)

## 📱 Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In your Netlify dashboard, go to "Domain settings"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

With GitHub integration, Netlify will automatically:
- Deploy when you push to the main branch
- Create preview deployments for pull requests
- Show build status in your GitHub repository

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check that Node.js version is set to 18
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard

### Routing Issues
- Verify `_redirects` file is in the root of your project
- Check that `netlify.toml` redirect rules are correct

### Performance Issues
- Check that chunk splitting is working properly
- Verify assets are being cached correctly

## 📊 Performance Optimization

The deployment includes:
- **Code splitting**: Automatic chunk splitting for faster loading
- **Asset optimization**: Minified and compressed assets
- **Caching headers**: Long-term caching for static assets
- **Security headers**: Basic security configurations
