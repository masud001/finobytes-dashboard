# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Fixed Configuration Issues

The main issue was in the `netlify.toml` file where the build paths were incorrectly configured for a subdirectory deployment.

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed `netlify.toml`**:
   - Removed incorrect `base = "finobytes-dashboard"` 
   - Changed `publish = "finobytes-dashboard/dist"` to `publish = "dist"`
   - This ensures Netlify builds from the root directory and publishes from the correct `dist` folder

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select the repository: `masud001/finobytes-dashboard`
   - Netlify will automatically detect the build settings from `netlify.toml`

3. **Build Settings** (should be auto-detected):
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Node version**: `18`

### Option 2: Manual Deploy

1. **Build locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Drag and drop the `dist` folder to deploy

## Configuration Files

### `netlify.toml` (Fixed)
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

# SPA routing
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

# Security and performance headers
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    X-Robots-Tag = "index, follow"
```

### `_redirects` (Correct)
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check Node.js version**: Ensure Netlify uses Node.js 18
2. **Verify build command**: Should be `npm run build`
3. **Check publish directory**: Should be `dist`
4. **Review build logs**: Look for specific error messages
5. **Test locally**: Run `npm run build` to ensure it works
